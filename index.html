    <h2> TE 466 - Self Branding Project</h2>
    <div id="topic" style="margin-bottom:20px;">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <ul>
        This is a project in regards to learning more about myself and understanding my brand and who I am as a person, especially after the time that i have spent here at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. After talking and learning more about myself through various friends and family members, I got to understand more about myself and the type of person I am. It seems I have different mixed results from what I thought about myself and what other think of me and I spent some time reading and analyzing more about myself. 
        </ul>
    </div> <!-- #topic -->
            <div id="topic">
            <h2>Strengths</h2>
            <ul style="text-align:left;">Problem Solving
                <li style="padding-left:20px;"> - Ability for me to come up with different perspectives and possible solutions to questions that arise help people think of a particular problem in a new way</li>
                <li style="padding-left:20px;"> - As a programmer, I have worked on several different team projects where expressing different ideas leads to change in plans for a particular approach for a project.</li>
                <li style="padding-left:20px;"> - When something new does come up during a project or something, I also get that slight frustration, but I know that I do not need to worry about it since it will only harm the development of the current process and I also know that there are others that will allow me to go through the same thing</li>            </ul>    
            <ul style="text-align:left;">Taking Initiative
                <li style="padding-left:20px;"> -  Whenever I work on different team projects as a software developer, there are many times where I have to learn a new language or new approach or new tools in order to successfully complete the project.</li>
                <li style="padding-left:20px;"> - For example, in my past internship of mine, we had to use different tools that the team had never used before and very few people in the company had used before and during meetings, I would let them know that I would be willing to go ahead and spend my time researching about how to use these tools and also set up meetings with other colleagues to get a better understanding of how to implement these tools into our project.</li>
                <li style="padding-left:20px;"> - This has impressed my colleagues and after spending time gathering and implementing everything, they are impressed by what I am able to accomplish given no specific instructions of what to do as it is more of an open-ended problem to solve. </li>            </ul>    
            <ul style="text-align:left;">Team Player
                <li style="padding-left:20px;"> - I always leave myself open to helping other members of the team understand a particular thing or go to the various team meetings we have, regardless of how important it is for me if I am working on something unrelated because I feel that it gives me a better understanding of what I am doing.</li>
                <li style="padding-left:20px;"> - People enjoy working and talking with me because it allows them to feel comfortable and relaxed when they are able to easily communicate with me and to play an important part of the team in general.</li></ul>
        </div> <!-- #topic -->
        <div id="topic">
            <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
            <ul style="text-align:left;"> Taking Over Meetings
                <li style="padding-left:20px;"> - Because there are so many people in a meeting at once, I feel the need to just sit in and listen as I do not want to disrespect my colleagues and take over when they are the ones directing the meeting.</li>
                <li style="padding-left:20px;"> - My colleagues were pleased that I did take over the meeting and layout the framework and set up meetings when necessary to gain more insight into certain areas.</li>
                <li style="padding-left:20px;"> - Colleagues would push and tell me to interrupat at times so that everyone else who is attending that meeting can learn more about my different perspectives and see how my ideas may or may not be incorporated. </li>            </ul>    
            <ul style="text-align:left;">Taking on too many projects
                <li style="padding-left:20px;"> -  I tend to enjoy learning new things in the computer science industry and because of that, I like to join different projects and teams in order to gain new technical skills. These projects that I usually end up joining are ones that I am interested in from the start and taking on these responsibilities are detrimental at times.</li>
                <li style="padding-left:20px;"> - Thinking about other things that I have done in the past, I did something similar again, along these lines, where I joined too many projects at once and I ended up having to quit one of them</li>
                <li style="padding-left:20px;"> - Although this is something I will need to work on where I am able to manage multiple different projects at once, I can definitely start off with learning how to spend my time wisely with fewer projects and gradually increase the load as I learn to prioritize the tasks at hand for the work that I am doing. 
</li>            </ul>    
            <ul style="text-align:left;">Too much attention on detail
                <li style="padding-left:20px;"> - I sometimes never complete something on time that should only take a very short time or something someone else would have finished already. It can be useful at times but it something that can cause harm much too often.</li>
                <li style="padding-left:20px;"> - In fact this past internship of mine, the team ended up resolving warnings and issues after we had finished a lot of our code that was used to build the application. I still did not feel comfortable with that sort of approach but it is something that I want to change and try focusing more on the bigger task at hand initially. </li></ul>

            <h2>Congruence</h2>
            <ul>
                In regards to both my internal and external analysis, there seems to be a mix of incongruences and congruences. I do agree in parts with a need of growth in being an effective communicator and taking over when needed, but I did not see myself to lose task when paying attention to detail. By my thoughts, it would help me understand much more and all, but it seems that it is something that people seem to believe the opposite of what I perceive. There are many others things that I can potentially work on to be an even better person to a team and continue to be what I am good at to be the very best in my career and in my personal life.         </ul>
        </div> <!-- #topic -->        <div id="topic">
            <h2>Feature-Benefits</h2>
            <ul>
            I am a person who has an open perspective over different things and willing to take in the views of other people. I don‚Äôt spend all my time doing the same thing over and over again. I like to learn new thing and I have the drive to do so and make sure that I make it a fun thing to do in my life. I have always interested in seeing what other people to think about i and see how I can use both those ideas and mine in order to be a great team player and make the work that I do very enjoyable. Although I may lack in certain areas such as communication and too much details, I provide people with the right amount of trust, reliability, and enjoyment when it comes to finding someone to work with and make the culture of a team much more lively.
