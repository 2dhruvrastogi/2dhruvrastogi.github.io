    <p> I am currently a senior pursuing my BS in Computer Science at the<a href="https://www.illinois.edu"> <b>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</b></a>. I am highly interested in data science/engineering, machine learning, and software development. </p>
    <p> In May 2016, I was a Software Engineering Intern at <a href="https://www.apple.com"><b>Apple</b></a>. I also have previous internships as a Software Engineering Intern at <a href="https://www.e-imo.com"><b>Intelligent Medical Objects</b></a> and at <a href="https://www.dow.com"><b>The Dow Chemical Company</b></a>. In February 2016, I participated with a team in <a href="https://www.hackillinois.org"><b>HackIllinois</b></a>, where we built <a href="https://hackillinois2015s.devpost.com/submissions/33718-outbreak"><b>Outbreak</b></a> and won 1st place for the IMO contest and were one of the top 5 software hacks. </p>
    <p> I have worked on other software projects during my college years and have worked on various technologies, both on the backend and front-end side. Besides technology, my hobbies include basketball, soccer, hiking, and travelling.</p>
